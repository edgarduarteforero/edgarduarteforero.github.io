A  discrete  simulation  model  was  developed,  it  represents  the  largest  delays  of  the units  which  impact  on  the  prolongation  in  the  length  of  stay  of  the  patients  and  the  high occupational  percentage  of  beds.  Later  a  design  of  experiments  was  made  by  developing scenarios which suggests different uses in the capacity and reduction in delays. It concludes that the  reduction  in  some  administrative  times  reduces the length  of  stay  but  higher  investments  as the addition of beds and a new rest room to the final care of patients,have a higher impact in the fast flow of patients in hospitalization.
