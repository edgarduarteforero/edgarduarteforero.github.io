**Introduction**: An  adequate  Resource  management  strategy  influences  significantly  on Quality  of  service  in  hospitals.  New technologies  in  healthcare, population  ageing  and  lack  of founding drive  to  continuous  improvements  in  hospitals’  capacity management in order to achieve a better performance of itself.

**Objective**: To  develop  tools that  may  allow  a  deeper  understanding  of  those  drivers  that  influence  global  hospital efficiency  (bed turnover, bed occupancy, length of stay) from the point of view of patients flow.

**Method**: A research based on Systems Dynamics was developed at a high complexity public hospital, emphasizing in the perspective of patients flow, the definition of parameters that influence capacity and the measurement of the impact of improvement strategies in global efficiency indicators. The study of strategies was based on Analysis of Variance and Principal component analysis (PCA).

**Results**:  Bed occupancy showed higher sensibility than other Key Performance Indicators (KPI) after the implementation of policies regarding the use of beds and the reduction of waiting times. Bed  turnover was the KPI with the fastest reaction after new policies implementation. Improvement in medical staff capacity at Emergency Rooms did not display significative impacts in patients flow nor global hospital efficiency.  Conclusions: Continuous simulation and PCA worked together to brought functional tools for capacity planning in middle and long terms. Investments should be dedicated to reduction of wasting through methodologies such as Lean Healthcare, rather than increasing installed capacity.
