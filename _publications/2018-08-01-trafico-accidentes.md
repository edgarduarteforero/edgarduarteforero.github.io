A simulation model based on System dynamics was developed to explore the specific relations among the behavior of drivers and the working pressure of their jobs, and the traffic controls made by government authorities. The analysis considers that an improvement in productivity and a fewer, but more intense traffic controls, is a valid strategy to reduce accidents in roads.
