This paper discusses the definition, testing and extrapolation of a modelbased on System Dynamics for the public collective system of transportationin Bogotá, D.C. Three main topics are studied: flow of  financial resources;flow of users and flow of vehicle fleet.Additionally three scenarios are simulated in order to evaluate the incidenceof  three public policies which are based on fares, number of  vehicles andincrease of  the road network. The results suggest that some causality cycleshave more impact in the size of the vehicle fleet, specifically those relatedwith the life span of  the vehicles, user fares and highway network.This study is intended to serve as a guide for the modeling of  some othertypes of transportation and their later integration with the proposed model.
